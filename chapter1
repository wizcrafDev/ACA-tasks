Hello, name is Nicholas i'm a candidate of a scholaship progam at ACA, it's been a very intensive and rigorous program so far NGL. we've been able to cover from HTML, CSS, javaScript, DOM and React and how to handle ourselves around Git and Version control.
these are all crucial information in the life of a developer and i'm grateful to be a member.
