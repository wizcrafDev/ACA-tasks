Hello, name is Nicholas I'm a student of ACA scholaship progam, it has been a very intensive and rigorous program so far NGL. We've been able to cover from HTML, CSS, javaScript, DOM (document object module), React an yeah how to handle ourselves around Git and Version control. an interestion but rushed session. like I said rigorous.
these are all crucial information in the life of a developer and i'm grateful to be a member.
